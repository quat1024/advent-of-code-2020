advent of code 2020 in funny rust language
==========================================

This is supposed to hold my solutions to [alexandria ocasio cortez 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) lets see if i do more than 3 days this time.

~~I'm bad at rust do not judge me I will cry~~ Please judge me, and tell me how to improve ;)

## Status

* day 1: parts A and B
* day 2: parts A and B
* day 3: parts A and B
* day 4: parts A and B
* day 5: parts A and B
* day 6: parts A and B
* day 7: parts A and B
* day 8: parts A and B

## Usage

Proper usage is "looking at it", you probably won't need to actually run these yourself lol. If you do want to run it, pass the number of the day you wanna runas an argument. If you don't pass anything it will use today's date (and probably index out of bounds and panic)

## TODO

- [x] Clean things up a bit more (some kind of Challenge trait?)
- [ ] Actually the Challenge trait is way overkill, go back to something simpler lmao
- [ ] Look into Rust libraries and tools that will help me out (parsing, errors, iteration...)
- [ ] Write tests that run all the challenges and compare them against their expected results
- [ ] Write new solutions in idiomatic Rust, and test that they are identical to the midnight brainfart ones
