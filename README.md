advent of code 2020 in funny rust language
==========================================

This is supposed to hold my solutions to [alexandria ocasio cortez 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) lets see if i do more than 3 days this time.

~~I'm bad at rust do not judge me I will cry~~ Please judge me, and tell me how to improve ;)

## Status

* day 1: parts A and B
* day 2: parts A and B

## Usage

Proper usage is "looking at it", you probably won't need to actually run these yourself lol. If you do want to run it, pass an argument such as `1b` for day 1 part b.

Note that the cwd is changed to the "work" directory in my launch.json, so I think by default with `cargo run` it won't be able to find input files. I might change this.

## TODO

* Clean things up a bit more (some kind of Challenge struct?)
* Look into Rust libraries and tools that will help me out (parsing, errors, iteration...)
* Write tests that run all the challenges and compare them against their expected results
* Write new solutions in idiomatic Rust, and test that they are identical to the midnight brainfart ones
